# Project Progress: Glimmer

## What Works

### Authentication
- ✅ OAuth-based authentication with Flickr
- ✅ Secure storage of user credentials in application preferences
- ✅ Login/logout functionality with proper UI feedback
- ✅ Automatic credential validation on application startup

### UI Components
- ✅ Main application window with tabbed interface
- ✅ Contacts tab with photo display
- ✅ Groups tab with basic structure
- ✅ Photo cards showing title, author, and image
- ✅ Infinite scrolling for contact photos
- ✅ Basic group cards showing group name and initial photos

### API Integration
- ✅ Flickr API client integration for authentication
- ✅ Methods for retrieving user's contacts and their photos
- ✅ Methods for retrieving user's groups and group photos
- ✅ Asynchronous image loading from Flickr URLs
- ✅ Organization of photos by group

## What's Left to Build

### Group Photos UI
- ⬜ "More..." button functionality to load additional photos for a group
- ⬜ Collapse/expand functionality for group cards
- ⬜ Configuration options for batch size and simultaneous downloads
- ⬜ Improved error handling and user feedback

### Performance Optimizations
- ⬜ Memory management for large numbers of photos
- ⬜ Caching of frequently accessed images
- ⬜ Optimized batch loading strategies

### Network Visualization
- ⬜ Visual representation of the user's Flickr network
- ⬜ Interactive exploration of connections between people, groups, and photos
- ⬜ Discovery features for finding new content

### Additional Features
- ⬜ Advanced analytics and insights about the user's Flickr network
- ⬜ Enhanced filtering and sorting options
- ⬜ Expanded visualization options

## Current Status

The application is in active development with a focus on completing the Group Photos functionality. The core infrastructure for authentication, API integration, and UI components is in place and working correctly. The next phase involves implementing the remaining features for the Group Photos UI, including the "More..." button functionality and collapse/expand feature.

### User Stories Progress

From the Group Photos design document:

* ✅ **Story 1: Initial UI Setup:** Create the main UI with two tabs: one for contact photos (placeholder) and one for group photos (initially an empty grid view).
* ✅ **Story 2: Fetch Group Photos:** Implement the background process to fetch the user's group photos using `api.GetUsersGroupPhotos`.
* ✅ **Story 3: Create Group Cards:** After fetching group data and waiting for the UI to be ready, create and display a card for each group.
* ⬜ **Story 4: Create Photo Cards:** Create photo cards for the first batch of photos in each group. Each card displays the photo title, author, and downloaded image. The image download should be managed by the card itself and perform asynchronously.
* ⬜ **Story 5: Implement "More..." Functionality:** Implement the "More..." button to load and display additional photo batches for a group.
* ⬜ **Story 6: Implement Collapse/Expand Functionality:** Implement the collapse/expand feature for group cards. Collapsed cards should hide photos but retain them for redisplay.
* ⬜ **Story 7: Configure Batch Size and Downloads:** Implement configuration options for photo batch size and the number of simultaneous image downloads.
* ⬜ **Story 8: Handle Errors:** Implement error handling for network issues, API errors, and image downloads. Display user-friendly messages.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- Decided to use the Fyne UI toolkit for cross-platform compatibility
- Chose to implement a tabbed interface for clear separation between contacts and groups
- Opted for asynchronous image loading to maintain UI responsiveness

### Refinements
- Added semaphore pattern to limit concurrent image downloads
- Implemented infinite scrolling for contact photos to improve browsing experience
- Organized group photos by group for better content discovery

### Current Considerations
- Evaluating strategies for efficient batch loading of photos
- Considering approaches for collapse/expand functionality that maintain state
- Exploring configuration options for batch size and concurrent downloads

## Known Issues

1. **Image Loading Performance**: When many photos are displayed simultaneously, image loading can be slow due to network limitations.
2. **Memory Usage**: The application may use significant memory when browsing large numbers of photos.
3. **Error Handling**: Error states during image loading or API calls could be communicated more clearly to the user.
4. **Group Card Layout**: The layout of group cards may need refinement for better visual organization.

## Next Milestones

1. Complete the "More..." button functionality (Story 5)
2. Implement collapse/expand for group cards (Story 6)
3. Add configuration options (Story 7)
4. Improve error handling (Story 8)
5. Begin work on network visualization features
