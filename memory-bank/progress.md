# Progress Log

## What Works
- Memory bank initialization with core documentation files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.

## What's Left to Build
- Flickr API integration and authentication.
- Data access layer for fetching photos, groups, and contacts.
- Application logic for managing photo views and data processing.
- UI layer for displaying photos and user interaction.
- Unit tests for all components (following TDD).

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialized and documented.
- Project context and technical decisions outlined.
- Go module and basic project structure to be set up.

## Known Issues
- None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use Go's `net/http` for UI to maintain simplicity and cross-platform compatibility. This may be revisited if more advanced UI features are required.
