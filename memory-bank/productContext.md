# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Many Flickr users, especially those with large photo libraries, find it challenging to efficiently manage and view specific types of photos, such as group photos and contact photos. Flickr's built-in interface, while functional, can be cumbersome for focused tasks like reviewing photos from a specific group event or quickly finding photos of a particular contact.

This project aims to create a dedicated application that streamlines the viewing and organization of group and contact photos from Flickr, providing a more user-friendly and efficient experience.

## Problems Solved
- **Inefficient Flickr Interface:** Flickr's web interface can be slow and cluttered, especially for users with large photo collections.
- **Lack of Focused Views:** Flickr doesn't offer dedicated, optimized views specifically for group photos or contact photos.
- **Organization Challenges:**  Organizing and tagging photos within Flickr can be time-consuming and less intuitive than desired.

## How It Should Work
The application will:
1. **Connect to Flickr API:** Authenticate with the Flickr API to access the user's photos and data.
2. **Fetch Group Photos:** Allow users to browse and view photos associated with Flickr groups they are members of or that they administer.
3. **Fetch Contact Photos:** Enable users to view photos of their Flickr contacts.
4. **Provide Streamlined UI:** Offer a clean, intuitive user interface focused on photo viewing and organization, potentially with features like filtering, sorting, and basic tagging.
5. **Operate as a Go Application:** Be built as a Go application, potentially cross-platform, offering good performance and responsiveness.

## User Experience Goals
- **Fast and Responsive:** The application should be quick to load and navigate, even with large photo libraries.
- **Intuitive and Easy to Use:** The interface should be straightforward and require minimal learning.
- **Focused and Efficient:** The application should excel at its core tasks: viewing and organizing group and contact photos.
- **Visually Appealing:** The UI should be clean and modern, enhancing the photo viewing experience.
