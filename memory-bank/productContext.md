# Product Context: Glimmer

## Purpose
Glimmer is designed to provide Flickr users with a way to visualize and explore the relationships between the people and groups they interact with on the platform. The application aims to reveal unseen connections in the user's Flickr network, enabling a deeper understanding of their online community.

## Problems Solved
1. **Discovery Challenge**: Finding new interesting photos, people, and groups on Flickr can be difficult without analyzing the social connections.
2. **Network Visualization**: Standard Flickr interfaces don't provide visual representations of how users, groups, and photos are interconnected.
3. **Content Exploration**: Users often miss potentially interesting content because they can't easily see the relationships between their existing connections.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Provide a clean, tabbed interface that allows users to easily switch between viewing contacts' photos and group photos.
2. **Efficient Browsing**: Implement infinite scrolling for contact photos and organized group cards for group photos.
3. **Visual Discovery**: Display photos in an aesthetically pleasing grid layout with clear attribution.
4. **Responsive Interaction**: Ensure all operations run in the background to maintain a smooth user experience.
5. **Seamless Authentication**: Provide straightforward OAuth-based login with secure credential storage.

## Target Users
- Flickr users who want to explore other people and photos they might not have found through traditional browsing.
