# Active Context: Glimmer

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the Group Photos functionality in the Glimmer application. This involves creating a UI that displays photos from the user's Flickr groups, organized by group, with features for loading more photos and collapsing/expanding group cards.

## Recent Changes

1. **Group Photos UI Structure**: The basic structure for displaying group photos has been implemented, including:
   - A tabbed interface with "Contacts" and "Groups" tabs
   - Group cards that display the group name and a grid of photos
   - Photo cards that show the image with title and author information
   - Asynchronous image loading to keep the UI responsive

2. **API Integration**: The application can now:
   - Fetch the user's groups from Flickr
   - Retrieve photos for each group
   - Organize photos by group for display

3. **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication with Flickr is fully implemented and working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete "More..." Functionality**: Implement the ability to load additional batches of photos for a group when the "More..." button is clicked.
   - This will require extending the existing group photos UI to handle incremental loading
   - Need to track which photos have already been loaded for each group

2. **Implement Collapse/Expand Functionality**: Add the ability to collapse and expand group cards.
   - When collapsed, the photos should be hidden but retained in memory
   - When expanded, the photos should be redisplayed without reloading

3. **Add Configuration Options**: Implement settings for:
   - Batch size for loading photos
   - Number of simultaneous image downloads

4. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and user feedback throughout the application.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Batch Loading Strategy**: Photos are loaded in batches to improve performance and reduce network usage. The initial implementation shows 4 photos per group with a "More..." button to load additional photos.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: All network operations and image loading are performed asynchronously to keep the UI responsive. The application uses goroutines, channels, and semaphores to manage concurrency.

3. **UI Component Structure**: The UI follows a component-based approach with reusable elements like cards, containers, and grids. This promotes consistency and maintainability.

4. **Testing Approach**: The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a focus on unit tests and mock implementations for external dependencies.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Clean Architecture**: The application maintains a clear separation between the API layer and UI layer, with well-defined interfaces between them.

2. **Component Composition**: UI components are composed of smaller, reusable elements to promote code reuse and maintainability.

3. **Asynchronous Loading**: Images and data are loaded asynchronously to keep the UI responsive.

4. **Lifecycle Management**: The application waits for the UI to be fully drawn before starting background operations.

5. **Error Handling**: Errors are logged and, where appropriate, displayed to the user.

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Flickr API Integration**: The Flickr API requires careful handling of authentication and response parsing. The `gopkg.in/masci/flickr.v3` library simplifies this process but still requires understanding of the API's structure.

2. **UI Responsiveness**: Keeping the UI responsive while loading potentially large numbers of images requires careful management of concurrency and background operations.

3. **Testing Challenges**: Testing UI components and asynchronous operations presents unique challenges that require mock implementations and careful test design.

4. **User Experience Considerations**: The application needs to balance showing enough photos to be useful while not overwhelming the user or the system with too many simultaneous downloads.
