# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the project memory bank and documentation.
- Setting up the basic project structure and Go module.
- Exploring the Flickr API and authentication methods.
- Designing the basic UI layout and navigation.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to define project goals and product context.

## Next Steps
- Create `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` to document system architecture and technology choices.
- Set up Go modules and basic project structure.
- Investigate Flickr API authentication and photo fetching.
- Start designing the UI layout, focusing on tab-based navigation for different photo views (group photos, contact photos).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **UI Framework:** Decide on a Go-based UI framework or library. Consider options like Fyne or web-based UI using `net/http`. For now, sticking with standard Go `net/http` for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Flickr API Authentication:** Determine the best approach for Flickr API authentication (OAuth 1.0a). Research Go libraries for Flickr API interaction.
- **Data Handling:** Plan how to fetch, cache, and display photos efficiently. Consider using goroutines for concurrent API requests.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Strict adherence to TDD workflow. Write tests before implementation.
- **Idiomatic Go Code:** Follow Go coding style conventions and best practices.
- **Clear Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project emphasizes focused photo management for Flickr users, addressing limitations of the standard Flickr interface.
- Go is chosen for UI development to ensure performance and cross-platform capabilities.
