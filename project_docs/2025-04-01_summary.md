# Project Summary - April 1, 2025

## Overview
The Glimmer application is a Flickr client that allows users to browse their contacts' photos and photos from groups they belong to. The application uses OAuth for authentication with Flickr and provides a tabbed interface for navigating between different sections.

## Current State

### Authentication
- OAuth-based authentication with Flickr is fully implemented
- User credentials are securely stored in application preferences
- Login/logout functionality is working correctly

### UI Components
- Main application with tabbed interface (Contacts and Groups tabs)
- Contact photos display with infinite scrolling
- Group photos display with collapsible group cards
- Photo cards showing title, author, and image

### API Integration
- Flickr API client integration for authentication, contacts, and groups
- Methods for retrieving user's groups and photos from those groups
- Asynchronous image loading from Flickr URLs

### Recently Completed
- **Group Photos UI**: Implemented the UI for displaying photos from user's Flickr groups
- **Photo Cards**: Created cards that display photo title, author, and asynchronously download and display the image
- **Group Organization**: Photos are organized by group, with each group displayed as a card containing a grid of photos

### In Progress
- **"More..." Functionality**: Adding the ability to load additional batches of photos for a group
- **Collapse/Expand**: Implementing the ability to collapse and expand group cards

### Next Steps
1. Complete the "More..." button functionality to load additional photos
2. Implement collapse/expand functionality for group cards
3. Add configuration options for batch size and simultaneous downloads
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Technical Details

### Architecture
The application follows a clean architecture with separation between:
- API layer (`api` package): Handles communication with Flickr
- UI layer (`ui` package): Manages the user interface components
- Data models: Represent Flickr entities (Photos, Contacts, Groups)

### Testing
- Unit tests for API functionality
- UI component tests for photo cards and group displays
- Mock implementations for testing Flickr API interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous image loading to keep the UI responsive
- Batch loading of photos to minimize network usage
- Lifecycle management to ensure UI is ready before starting operations
