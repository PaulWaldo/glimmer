# Project Summary - March 15, 2025

## Overview
This project appears to be a Flickr client application with both API integration and UI components. The application allows users to authenticate with Flickr, view contacts, groups, and photos.

## Key Components

### API Layer
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication system with Flickr
- **Contacts**: Functionality to retrieve and manage Flickr contacts
- **Photos**: Ability to fetch photos from contacts and groups
- **Groups**: Support for user groups and their photos

### UI Components
- **Main Application**: A tabbed interface with sections for contacts and groups
- **Photo Cards**: UI components for displaying photos with metadata
- **Photo View**: Detailed view for individual photos
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Implementation for loading more photos as the user scrolls

### Data Structures
- Comprehensive models for Flickr entities (Photos, Contacts, Groups)
- Support for OAuth tokens and authentication flow

### Testing
- Mock implementations for testing the Flickr API interactions
- Image loading tester for UI components

## Current State
The application has a functioning authentication system with Flickr and can store user credentials securely. The UI framework is in place with tabs for different sections of the application. Photo loading and display functionality is implemented with support for lazy loading and infinite scrolling.

Some features appear to be in development:
- The group photos functionality has placeholder implementations for downloading images
- There are TODOs in the code indicating incomplete features

The project follows a clean architecture with separation between the API layer and UI components, making it maintainable and extensible.
